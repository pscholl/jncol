= jncol - jennic protocol collection =

 This project collects protocols for accessing Jennics microcontroller
functionality remotely through a 6lowpan based tcp/ip stream. The following
features are currently supported:

== serial line ==

 The serial lines can be accessed on port 4404 (UART0) and 4405 (UART1). After a
modeline, that selects the baudrate and data format of the serial line, has been
sent all traffic on the serial line will be relayed through the tcp stream and
vice versa. This creates a wireless UART connection. For example if the jennic
modules address is 3ffe::15:86:00:00:0b:67:c3, and your network is properly
setup you can access the modules serial port by opening a tcp connection on port
4404. We use telnet here as an example:

> telnet 3ffe::15:86:00:00:0b:67:c3 4404
  115200 8N1 rtscts
  ...

 This opens up UART0 on the jennic module, selects the baudrate to be 115200
bauds in 8bit, no parity, 1 stop bit and RTS/CTS flowcontrol. After that data
can be exchanged through the serial port.

 A word of warning, the tcp stream can easily become defunct if the remote
device is unable to handle data at the speed it is sent through the tcp stream.
So you have to make sure that the device connected on the serial line is able to
handle the data at the speed it is sent through the tcp stream.
